<h2 id="rndEncLst">Random Encounter List</h2>
<p>Making a list of things the players can bump into while exploring is the BEST WAY to add a bit of life to your session. It keeps 
    both the players, and yourself guessing.<br><b>A good encounter list:</b></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
        <li>Should be about six entries. Works with a d6 and lets you focus on creating six cool things, instead of 20 mediocre things.</li>
        <li>Should include variance on a common theme:</li>
        <ul><li>1: Something Deadly! (1: A Litch, gathering ingredients, could trade spell knowledge.</li>
            <li>2-4: Theme Variety (Dragon Kin; 2- Hunting Rats, 3- Arguing 'who is boss', 4- Drinking Games!)</li>
            <li>5: W.L.G. or faction (5: three gnome traders in an ogre costume, Fish Oil potions, persuasive)</li>
            <li>6: Strange, Uncommon (6: The warrior Garos, Wants a warriors death, but only if provided w/ a compelling battle twist)</li></ul>
        <li>Should include at least one means of foreground growth (The litch, trade with the gnomes, learn from dragon kin)</li>
        <li>Should not all lead to immediate combat. Make the elements want something!</li>
        <li>Could include environmental hazards (1st: Caves Creak and groan, 2nd: ceiling falls in!)
        <li>Could simply touch on theme (A cold breeze blows, smells of death)</li>
        <li>Should include modifiers to a reaction roll, dictated by what the creatures are up to.</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Advice</h1>

<h3>Hooks</h3>
<p>Make hooks compelling reasons to go do the adventure, not an excuse why the players are there.<br>
<b>Start your design work here.</b> You can work backwards from a cool location, but it's easier to start with a hook.<br>
<b><i>The enchanted sword of St. Crawn, Oath-eater is rumoured to rest in his tomb. We know it's in the woods to the West of town,
    but nobody alive remembers how to get there.</i></b></p>

<h3>Language</h3>
<p>Not everything speaks common. Once again, for me this time "<b>Not everything speaks common!</b>" I forget too, and it's usually more
    interesting to speak to the little assholes instead of just killing them. Mausritter did it best. Each creature variety speaks there own
    racial language. The more similar they are in species, the more likely they can <i>~kind of~</i> communicate.<br>
    Kobolds can kinda speak dragon. Goblins can kinda speak Orc, who can kinda speak human.<br>
    Also, roadblocks are good sometimes, let the wizard get creative.</p>

<h3>Traps</h3>
<p>Traps should have <b>No Obvious Solutions!</b> but be easily discernable. Give them multiple solutions, or let clever ideas 
work to circumvent it.<br>
Avoid requiring specific items or tools. That's a lock, not a trap.<br><br>
Some traps can be easy to break, avoid. They become tools for the players to use against enemies.</p>
<p>The best traps are obvious, they need:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
    <li>A reason to engage with the trap. Does it block passage? Grant a key?</li>
    <li>A visible mechanism. Rock fall, you die SUCKS!</li>
    <li>An explicit risk. this floor tile is covered in severed feet. Good luck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, put them in logical places. Busy hallways suck. Tucked away closets and cupboards are best.</p>

<h2>Adventure Design</h2>
<p>As of December 2025, I'm of two minds about adventure design. It looks like this:</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="column2">
        <h3>The players want a dungeon crawl</h3>
        <p>Render unto Caesar, that which is Caesar's.<br>
        Design a crawl, put some sweet loot in. level up. Bonus points for having a story to puzzle through as the PCs delve
        and uncover secrets.<br>
        Start with the hook. Design a location around that as the procedures below. Done and done.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column2">
        <h3>The players want a 'story' adventure</h3>
        <p>Some players don't want to critically think their way through Deathtrap Dungeon. They want to interface with odd NPCs, and 
            react to story beats happening around them.<br>
            Start with a hook, then flesh out various encounters that will tell a story that concludes in the hook.<br>
            Super rail-road-y, but whatever. <br><br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>Maybe mixing and matching is the way to go.</p>
</div>


<h2>Region Design</h2>
<p>What is here and why. Come up with a theme to use as a touchstone. Where does food and 'work' come from?
    Pick a couple factions, and note what they want here. Note a few wild creatures. <b>THEN:</b><br><br>
    Drop a handful of dice onto a sheet of paper. Circle where they fall, and note the die result within.<br>
        Higher die sizes give more rare locations, up to d12.</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="column2" style="width: fit-content;">
        <table>
            <tr><th>d12</th><th>Fantasy</th><th></th><th></th></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>Landmark</td><td>7</td><td>Dungeon</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2</td><td>Landmark</td><td>8</td><td>Keep</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3</td><td>Traders</td><td>9</td><td>Village</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4</td><td>Ruins</td><td>10</td><td>Town</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5</td><td>Tomb</td><td>11</td><td>City</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6</td><td>Wizard Tower</td><td>12</td><td>Garrison</td></tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <div class="column2">
        <table>
            <tr><th>d12</th><th>Sci-Fantasy</th><th></th><th></th></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>Landmark</td><td>7</td><td>Vault</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2</td><td>Landmark</td><td>8</td><td>Arcology</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3</td><td>Camp</td><td>9</td><td>Trading Post</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4</td><td>Ruin</td><td>10</td><td>Settlement</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5</td><td>Grave</td><td>11</td><td>Oasis</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6</td><td>Anomaly</td><td>12</td><td>Holy Place</td></tr>
        </table>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Draw some lines that connect the nodes, these are known travel routes. <br>
Even to Even is generally safe for travel, Odd to Odd has a known danger.<br>
Roughly scale out the line lengths: Short lines= d6 hexes between, Mid= 2d6 hexes, and long= 3d6 hexes.<br><br>
Most importantly, made a d6 Random encounter list that follows <a href="#rndEncLst">this</a> formula.</p>

<h2>Site Design</h2>
<p>Similar to region design, try to come up with a concept before meticulously mapping out a site. Think about what the location 
    was, and what it is now. Roll on some tables for inspiration. <br><br>
    Think about what NPCs, Creators and Factions could be in here, and what they may want.<br>
    Make one of those creatures a <b>Weird Little Guy</b> that fucking loves it here. <br><br>
    Think about what the 'reward' for coming here is, why the PCs should bother at all. Write it down as your hook.<br><br>
    Finally, think about a <b>theme</b>. It's important, and will help answer questions later.
<br><br><br>With all that in mind, grab a handful of d6, and a sheet of paper. Plan on 3 or 4 exploration turns per die, as 
each die represents numerically to how many exploration turns that 'node' will take to traverse.<br>
Each 'node' could be one large room, or several daisy chained rooms.<br>
If a d6 averages 3.5, I can assume (on average) that two dice should result in 1 hour of 10 minute turns, so If I want my cave to take the players
4 hours of 'in game' time to delve, I would roll 8 dice onto a page.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Circle where each die landed, and note the number of turns spent in that 'node'.</li>
    <li>Then, for each 'node' roll a d10, this time reference the chart below for what the contents of that 'node' is.</li>
</ol>
<div class="row">
    <div class="column3" style="width: fit-content;">
    <table><tr><th>d10</th><th>Node Contents</th></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>a Trap</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2</td><td>a Creature (No Treasure)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3-6</td><td>Empty</td></tr>
        <tr><td>7-8</td><td>Monster (2x treasure packs)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>9</td><td>Special</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0</td><td>Hidden Treasure</td></tr>
    </table>
    </div>
    <div class="column3" style="width: fit-content;">
        <table>

            <tr><td>1</td><td>Boon</td><td>Supply or an exploitable trap.</td></tr>

            <tr><td>4</td><td>Lore</td><td>Reveal some history</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5</td><td>Puzzle</td><td>Gear, Knowledge</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6</td><td>Lock or Key</td><td>Friendly?</td></tr>
        </table>

    </div>
    <div class="column3">
        <table>
            <tr><th>d6</th><th>Empty Room</th><th>Desc.</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>Safe</td><td>Close the door to secure</td></tr>

        </table>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Draw a few lines to connect up your nodes. Think about stairs, and loops. Old dungeon heads call it 'jaquaising' the dungeon.<br>
    <b>Put up roadblocks. Think of locked paths that have 'keys that aren't keys'.</b></p>
    
<h3>Bring it all together</h3>
<p>This is all representational at the moment. You could run it as a point crawl as is, but if you are feeling artistic, sit 
down with some graph paper and draw some squares. Remember that each 'node' takes d6 turns to explore, so don't pad out the 
time with long corridors (unless the corridor is your 'zone')</p>

<h2>Random Exploration</h2>
<p>Good luck friend. Room Contents d10: 1 Trap, 2 Monster (no $), 3-6 Empty, 7-8 Monster (2x[$]),9 Special, 0 hidden $<br>
    For monsters, spend &#9673; on the chart below by level: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
</p>

<h2>Stocking Monsters and Treasures</h2>
<p>Design one area of a dungeon as about 10 connected zones.<br>
    This could be one level of the dungeon, or a part of a single large level.<br><br>
For that 10 zone chunk consider:</p>
<ul>
    <li>About four <i>Empty</i> zones.</li>
    <li>About three zones occupied with Monsters, two of which are holding two bundles of treasure.</li>
    <li>One Special zone.</li><li>One trap.</li><li>One zone with a hidden treasure bundle.</li>
</ul>

<div class="row">
    <div class="column2" style="width: 42%;">
        <h3>Treasure</h3>
        <p><br>Put enough treasure in each level to allow 2 PCs of that level to level up once. so:<br>

        <br>The size of a '<b>bundle of treasure</b>' should be: <br>
        <b><i>( 2 x [Silver to Level Up] ) /5</i></b><br style="padding-bottom: 1em;"></p>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Level</th><th>Per Bundle</th><th>Total Silver</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>20</td><td>100</td></tr>

<h3>Treasure Tables in other games</h3>
<p><b>B/X style games</b><br>
    In each d5*10 'level' of the dugneon, there should be enough XP to level (expected number of PCs +1) fighters of that 'level'.<br>
<i>(This is split between treasure (65%), and xp from monsters(35%))</i><br>
<b>ODND via Swords & Wizardry</b><br>
build a dungeon as you see fit. Stock it with creatures and make a wandering monster table.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Total up the xp from all of the monsters placed (not the wanderers), then multiply that number by d4+1 (Or # of PCs +1)</li>
    <li>That number is how much GP to distribute through that level of the dungeon.</li>
    <li>Roll through the substitution tables, swapping out discrete amounts of GP from the total</li>
    <li>The amount remaining is then converted to coin and squirrelled around the map.</li>
    <li>Some of the treasure will me missed or ignored if too dangerous.</li>
    <li>To then convert to my heartbreaker:<br>
        <ul><li>After the above steps getting a total and rolling through sub. tables;</li>
            <li>Take that remaining GP value, move the decimal to the left once, and then half.</li>
            <li>That number is how much to hide in Silvers.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<p>For Example: if a small area contains two Ogres (120xp ea):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Two Ogres => 240xp</li>
    <li>240xp * d4+1(3) => 720gp area total</li>
    <li>Roll 7 times on the 100gp substitution table, noting results</li>
    <li>Pretend 2 hit, leaving 500gp to be scattered through the level</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Take that 500gp, move the decimal left => 50gp</li>
        <li>Then half that to 25 silvers to hide in the Ogre's lair.</li>
    </ul>

</ul>


<h3>Digging Deeper</h3>
<p>Making a multi level complex? Roll d6 for how many levels deep the dungeon goes.<br>
Consider the hierarchy of creatures, which BBEG is on which level of the dungeon.<br>
Consider where they are getting food / water from (Mushrooms and a river? Check!)<br>
Most importantly, consider conflicts and fissures the PCs can use to their advantage.<br>
Sketch out shortcuts between levels?
</p>



<h3>Outdoor Locations</h3>
<p>Design them the same way you design dungeons, connect locations, and make an hour of travel between each for point crawls.</p>

<h3>Keying</h3>
<p>If you are going to key the place for later use, follow the Landmark ( hidden[ secret ] ) philosophy.<br>
<b>Landmarks</b> are common knowledge, seen without searching, but may include more details when examined. The dresser is a landmark.<br>
<b>( Hidden )</b> information is just that. Only revealed with a bit of time. The contents of the dresser's bottom drawer is hidden.<br>
<b>[ Secret ]</b> information needs a bit of time, AND luck. You can make it a save, but if the players come up with a compelling arguement,
give it to them. The trip-wire and bell connected to the backside of the drawer is Secret knowledge.<br><br>
<b>Use this philosophy keying everything.</b><br><br>
Example;<br>
<b>Room 6</b> - Bedroom<br>
A strong musky smell, a <b>Bookcase</b> stands on the Northern wall. Tatty curtains cover a <b>window</b> to the east. The scent 
originates from a lump in the <b>bed</b>.</p>
<ul><li><b>Bookcase:</b>Detailed Carving, water damage (leather armour in bottom drawer [ string attached to back rings loud bell] )</li>
    <li><b>Bed:</b> Describe the <b>lump</b> here.</li>
    <ul><li><b>Lump: </b>details below</li></ul>
    <li><b>Window: </b>and on and on and on</li>
</p>
