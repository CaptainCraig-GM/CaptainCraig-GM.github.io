<p><i>If the character does not have a backpack, they have a belt (2 slots), one of which holds a S.Sack (3) to hold their gear.</i><br><br>
Perhaps most importantly, try to imagine your character's personality from the gear they start with. Try to find a reason <i>WHY</i> they
would risk life and limb to head out into the dangerous wilds.<br>
<i>"To get Rich!"</i> is okay, but <i>"To get rich so I can afford an army to overthrow the corrupt duke."</i> is better.<br>
Don't worry about a back story, we'll make that as we adventure.</p>

<h1 id="levelUp">Character Levels</h1> 
<p>There are two ways to track leveling in my heartbreaker. You can either delve into dangerous areas to collect gold and crap worth gold, bring it
    back to civilization and spend money on training, Or you can, <b>as a group</b>, decide that something cool just happened, and one person
    should earn a milestone and level up.</p> <br>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Spending Money to Level</th>
            <th>Milestone leveling</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Player spends X amount on training when in a safe location.</td>
            <td>Lowest level writes on sheet which milestone granted level.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Player who spent gold on themselves levels.</td>
            <td>Lowest level character levels.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p><br></p>
    <p><br>In either case, you can only level if you are in a safe space, and have somebody knowledgeable there to train you in the specific <a href="Classes.html">class</a> you
        are taking. A typical class will consist of a bonus that increases with each level of that class you take, along with an ability that
        'unlocks' with each level that you take in that class.<br><br>

    <p><br>Each level you take in a class grants you the class' Boon, and the next letter perk that you don't have yet.<br>
    <b>You can only take four levels in one class</b> then you must choose a separate class. You are allowed to mix and match up until level five.<br>
    After level five, you are forced to choose: Replace one of the class levels you have taken already with a different class, <b>OR</b> Keep your 
    class choices and gain one luck.<br><br>
    <b>Finally,</b> choose one of your abilities that are under 18. Roll 1d20. If you roll over you ability score, increase it by 1 up to a maximum of
    18.<br><br>

  <b>Example Class - Ranger</b><br>
    <b>Boon:</b> Each level taken in ranger grants a +1 bonus to damage rolled with your chosen weapon type.</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li><b>Favoured Weapon:</b> Gain damage boon to chosen weapon attacks.<br> <b>Favoured Enemy:</b>Deal +d8 bonus damage to chosen foes.</li>
        <li><b>Favoured Biome:</b> Results of random encounters and the range in which they occur tend toward your favour. You are also less likely 
            to get lost in your chosen biome.</li>
        <li><b>Animal Buddy:</b> A woodland friend seeks you out (Minion). They will obey your commands to the best of their ability.</li>
        <li><b>Better All Round:</b> Your buddy can now have the stats of a Grunt. You can choose a second enemy type and biome.</li>
