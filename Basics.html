        <h1>Overview</h1> <div id="Overview"></div>
        <p>In this game, characters stay squishy, even at higher levels, because levels grant more tools, not more power. Magic is powerful and scary.<br>
            <b>Combat should not be taken lightly!</b><br>
            Gameplay is highly proceduralized from a Referee's perspective, and player skill is prioritized over character's abilities. Asking lots
            of questions and acting cleverly on the information gathered prevents you putting yourself in danger.<br>
            Make a goal for your character, and follow it's lead.
        </p>


        <h1>Character Stats</h1>
        <h3>Abilities</h3>
        <p>Player characters have three ability scores: <b>Strength, Dexterity, Charisma</b> that are rated from 3 to 18.<br></p>
        <ul><li><b>Strength:</b> Muscles, Health, Vim and Viogur</li>
            <li><b>Dexterity:</b> Balance, Agility, Reflexes</li>
            <li><b>Charisma:</b> Looks, Wherewithal, Mental Prowess</li></ul>
        <h3>Hit Protection and Armour</h3>
        <p><b>hp</b> is better though of as <i>Hit Protection</i>, as it represents a characters ability to avoid taking damage while in combat situations.<br>
        It is a quickly refreshing resource. You start with 1d6 hp and gain more from taking <a href="Combat.html#scarTable">scars</a>. It is refreshed after a fight by taking a 
        ten minute breather.<br>
        <b>Armour</b> is a number that spans 0 to 3.  Regular street clothes provides 0 armour, while a dragon or a set of powered armour would have 3 armour.<br>
        Any damage taken is reduced by your armour value.<br>
        Armour never goes above 3.</p>

        <h3>Inventory</h3>
        <p>A character can happily lug around ten slots worth of gear if they have the belt / bags / packs to carry it.<br>
        A naked character can carry around something in each hand.  Having a belt provides two additional slots. A typical pack will allow up to six
        more slots of encumbrance. Thus, a typical character will have <i><b>Two hands slots, Two belt slots, and six pack slots</b></i> available.<br>
        <br>You can carry more, up to a maximum of fourteen slots of equipment, <b>but:</b></p>
        <ul><li>Each slot over ten comes with a cumulative +1 penalty to STR and DEX saves you make.</li>
            <li>If any PC is over the ten slot limit, the group's <a href="Ref_Facing.html#points">travel speed</a> is reduced for the day by roughly 6 miles (1 hex).</li></ul>
        <p>Objects stowed away in your pack take one combat turn to retrieve and put to use.<br><br>
        <b>Slots</b> are an abstract measure of weigh. Roughly speaking a 1 one-handed weapon is 1 slot.</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 10px;"><li>Tiny objects like rings or gems do not require as slot, so long as you have pockets or room in a pack.</li>
            <li>Middleing objects take up one slot per 3 items (Torches, Rations, Stakes)</li>
            <li>Larger objects can take up two or three slots (Plate Armour or Riot Shield: 2, picking up a small pig: 3</li>
            <li>Unwieldly or over-large object are designated <b><i>Bulky (b)</i></b>.</li></ul>
        <p>A character can carry two bulky items, but <b>having <i>a third bulky item reduces the character's hit protection to zero</i>.</b></p>

        <h3>At Higher Levels</h3>
        <p>Once a character gains a bit of <a href="Character.html#levelUp">experience</a>, they may also need to track:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 10px;"><li><b>MD:</b> Magic Dice. You roll them to <a href="Magic.html">cast spells</a>. Don't get doubles.</li>
            <li><b>Luck:</b> Spend it on others to allow them to <a href="#lucky">reroll</a> dice. Refreshes between sessions.</li>
            <li><b>Class:</b> Get <a href="Classes.html">trained</a> to learn specific abilities.</li>
            <li><b>Conditions:</b> Sometimes good, usually <a href="#conds">bad</a>.</li></ul>

<h1>Making Saves</h1>
<p>The bulk of checks made in this game come in the form of saves. You make a save when you are try to avoid the effects of something
    bad happening to you.<br><br>
    Make a save by rolling a d20 and comparing the result to your related ability.<br>
    Rolling <b>on or under your ability score means success</b>, and you avoid the danger.<br><br>
    Saves can get a bonus or penalty (from -4 to +4) depending on what is happening in the fiction. <br><br></p>

    <div class="boxedText">
        When you are attempting to accomplish a task, and you complete the trinity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have time to spend on the action, and</li>
            <li>You have the skills required to complete the task, and</li>
            <li>You have the gear required to complete the task...</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>&emsp;You don't have to roll!!</b> Your attempt just succeeds.<br><br>
        However, if you are missing one leg of the trinity, that's when checks come into play.<br>
        Asking lots of questions and acting on gathered information helps prevent rolling checks in the first place.</p>
    </div>


<h1>Getting Hurt</h1>
<p>Weapon damage is centered on a d6 (sword), with a d12 (Cannon) representing the worst you can be hit with.<br>
You start with d6 hit protection, and that maxes out at 3d6 sometime in the future. <b>Getting hit sucks.</b> Be careful.<br><br>
When you take damage this is what happens:</p>
<ol>
    <li>If you have armour on, reduce the damage received by that amount.</li>
    <li>If you have hp left, you will reduce your hp by the damage received.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>If you stop at exactly 0 hp: <b>Great!</b> You have gotten a <a href="Combat.html#scarTable">scar</a>, and may get more hp !</li>
        <li>If you still have damage to remove after losing all of your hp:</li>
        <ul><li>You will remove the remaining damage from your current Strength score.</li>
            <li>Each time your Strength is reduced, you have to make a Strength Save to prevent <b>Critical Damage</b>.</li></ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Follow this exact process for taking Dexterity or Charisma damage as well.</li>
    <li><b>If ever you hit 0 Strength, you are dead.</b> At 0 Dexterity you are paralyzed, and at 0 Charisma you are brain-dead.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="critdmg">Critical Damage</h3><p>Critical Damage is a condition that means you are incapacitated for the remainder of the fight. You are knocked out, or 
    yelling in pain or dazed... basically unable to act until you are tended to by an ally. If you are left un-attended for more than an hour, you
    will die.
</p>

<h1>Rest and Recovery</h1>
<p>Spending a <a href="Ref_Facing.html">turn</a> collecting yourself after a fight refreshes your hp though runs the risk of another encounter.<br>
Spending a night somewhere safe refreshed 1 point of lost ability score.<br>Spending a night in a tent allows you to make a save to see if you 
can regain 1 point.<br>
Spending a full week somewhere safe refreshes all of your lost ability points.</p>

<h1 id="conds">Conditions</h1>
<p>Some good, most bad, all pretty easy to track.</p>
<h3>Blast Damage</h3>
<p>Damage with the Blast keyword (d6b) deals damage to each character in a zone.</p>
<h3>Critical Damage</h3>
<p>See above. Unable to act without aid and you will die within an hour if left alone.</p>
<h3>Deprived</h3>
<p>You are missing a critical need. Food, water or sleep. You are unable to benefit from resting.</p>
<h3>Exhaustion</h3>
<p>You lose access to one of your inventory slots. Exhaustion stacks. Getting a good night's rest clears all exhaustion.</p>
<h3>Enhanced</h3>
<p>Your attacks are particularly effective. Roll a bonus damage die along with your standard attack dice, taking the best result rolled.</p>
<h3>Impaired</h3>
<p>Your attacks are particularly ineffective. Roll only a d4 for the attack, with no bonus die allowed.</p>
<h3>Prone</h3>
<p>Getting knocked down carries a 50% chance of hitting your head and being dazed for d2 turns. (no attacking, Ed6 damage against you)</p>
<h3>Well Rested and Very Well Rested</h3>
<p>Make a Charisma Save to regain a second Ability point. Very gives you 2 automatically, and Saves for a third.</p>
<h3>Well Fed and Very Well Fed</h3>
<p>Make your <i>Well Rested</i> Save with -2 bonus, or a -4 bonus if Very Well Fed.</p>

<h1 id="warbands">Warbands and Structural Damage</h1>
<p>When enemies group up, they become a warband. Individual attacks against a warband are Impaired unless they deal Blast damage, while attacks from 
    a warband to individuals is dealt enhanced Ed10. <br><br>
    Individuals attacking structures deal Impaired damage.
</p>

<h1 id="lucky">Luck</h1>
<p>Once you earn a small pool of luck, you can expend one of your luck points to have an ally reroll any die that you 'see' them roll.<br>
The luck pool refreshes after each session, so burn them up.</p>
