<h1>Magic</h1>
<p>Magic is powerful and fickle. The most folk mistrusts it, and will shun the use of it publicly.<br>
You need to find somebody to train you in the arts, and most are not willing to share their knowledge.</p>

<h2>Casting</h2>
<p>Spells are stored in spell books, wands and scrolls. You need the source in your hand to be able to cast.<br>
You decide how many Magic Dice (MD) to invest in the casting, and roll them.<br>
Each spell will have effects based on either how many die are rolled [die], or the sum of all die rolled [sum].<br>
<b>Dice that roll 1-3 are returned, while dice that roll 4-6 are lost for the day.</b><br>
More dice invested grants a stronger spell, with a higher chance for spell burn (doubles) or doom (triples).</p>

<h3>Spell List</h3>
<p><a href="Spells.html">Here</a></p>

<h3>Appearances</h3>
<p>Track and have NPCs comment on odd looking characters. This is the only real downside to so much power... </p>
