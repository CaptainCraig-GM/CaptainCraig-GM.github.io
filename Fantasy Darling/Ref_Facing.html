<h1>Referee Facing Rules</h1>
<p>Keep the procedural stuff set in stone, expose your tables, let he player exploit their hard won knowledge.<br><br>
    <b>Be fun.</b></p>

<h2 id="dieoffate">The Die of Fate</h2>
<p>Be a fan of the characters. Don't give them everything they ask for. When you need some serious <i>'Neutral Arbiter Inspiration'</i> chuck 
out your <b><u>DIE OF FATE !!</u></b> It's a d6. Results of 1 are bad for the players, results of 6 are great for them. Adjust as the 
fates require.</p>


<h2>Time and Turns</h2>
<p>In <a href="Economy.html#downtime">Down-Time</a>, time flows around as we require it to. We can pass of weeks at a time to accomplish tasks, or drill into moments for important
    conversations.<br><br>
    While <a href="#hexcrawl">hex-crawling</a>, we will break the day down into Morning, Afternoon, Evening and Night chunks, where you can travel, forage, search and die
    with ease.<br><br>    
    During <a href="#dungcrawl">Dungeon Crawls</a>, we measure time in turns, which are 10 minute chunks of time.</p>

<p><br>During <a href="Combat.html">fights</a> we measure time in rounds, which are 10 - 15 second chunks of chaos. You can move to an adjacent 'zone' and do something here
    there. If you are not doing anything but moving, you can move to a 'faraway zone'.<br>Actions fire off simultaneously each round,
    with initiative winners having a slight edge up on the losers.
    <br><br>
    An encounter takes up a 10 minute turn, with the remaining minutes used cleaning swords, checking equipment, looting bodies... </p>
</p>
<h3>Adventure Day</h3>
<p>Breaking up the day into three watches of 5 hours, and a night of 9 hours works great:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
    <li><b>Morning: </b>6 7 8 9 10</li>
    <li><b>Afternoon:</b>11 12 1 2 3</li>
    <li><b>Evening:</b> 4 5 6 7 8</li>
    <li><b>Night:</b> 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="encounters">Random Encounters, Wandering Assholes and Fighting to the Death</h2>
<p>I check for random encounters once a day while hex-crawling, and each night (2 or 3 times at night if the area is dangerous). While dungeon delving, 
    I check every third turn (or every second turn in dangerous areas). If the characters are especially noisy with their actions, or if they players are 
    taking a LONG time to choose a course of action I check again then too.
    <br><br>What checking for encounters means is that I roll a d6:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>if the result is a 1 the characters face an encounter on the next ten minute turn.</li>
        <li>If the result is a 2, I signpost the next encounter and when the next encounter check results in a 1, that is the encounter I use.</li>
    </ul> 
<p><br>This mechanic is a time pressure to put on the players so they can't reroll lock-picking checks 200 times until they succeed at everything.<br>
    Random encounters also add variety and verisimilitude to your game. The key is that the players don't have to fight each little thing. Again...<br>
<b>An encounter does not mean instant battle !!!</b> Far from it. <b><u>This is probably the biggest feature that defines OSR play in my book.</u></b> <br>
For each encounter, roll both a reaction roll, and a range roll.</p>

<h2 id="rndEncLst">Random Encounter List</h2>
<p>Making a list of things the players can bump into while exploring is the BEST WAY to add a bit of life to your session. It keeps 
    both the players, and yourself guessing.<br><b>A good encounter list:</b></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
        <li>Should be about six entries. Works with a d6 and lets you focus on creating six cool things, instead of 20 mediocre things.</li>
        <li>Should include variance on a common theme:</li>
        <ul><li>1: Something Deadly! (1: A Litch, gathering ingredients, could trade spell knowledge.</li>
            <li>2-4: Theme Variety (Dragon Kin; 2- Hunting Rats, 3- Arguing 'who is boss', 4- Drinking Games!)</li>
            <li>5: W.L.G. or faction (5: three gnome traders in an ogre costume, Fish Oil potions, persuasive)</li>
            <li>6: Strange, Uncommon (6: The warrior Garos, Wants a warriors death, but only if provided w/ a compelling battle twist)</li></ul>
        <li>Should include at least one means of foreground growth (The litch, trade with the gnomes, learn from dragon kin)</li>
        <li>Should not all lead to immediate combat. Make the elements want something!</li>
        <li>Could include environmental hazards (1st: Caves Creak and groan, 2nd: ceiling falls in!)
        <li>Could simply touch on theme (A cold breeze blows, smells of death)</li>
    </ul>

<h1 id="hexcrawl">Hex-Crawling</h1>
<p><b>All of these mechanics are referee facing.</b> Keep a copy of your hex map (Mine is coloured pencil designating terrain types, with little 
    numbered ink icons designating features [house 1; or cave 6]). Keep a page or two after your map keying the features.<br></p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Each Morning, roll to see if the party gets <a href="#morningCheck">lost, or has an encounter</a> in the day ahead.</li>
    <li>Roll to see how the weather has changed <i>(I roll this ahead of time by a month or two)</i></li>
    <li>Determine how many <strong>&bull;</strong> (<a href="#points">points</a>) the party can spend for the day.</li>
    <li>Describe the area around the characters, keep the focus zoomed out until an encounter or a <a href="#features">feature</a> is discovered.<br>
        Listen to the player's intent for their turn.</li>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Traveling: </b>Spend <strong>&bull;</strong> to move along the hexes as needed.</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>As each hex is entered, describe the area around the characters, and let them change course if desired.</li>
            <li>When they enter a hex for the first time, determine if they stumble into the hex's <a href="#features">feature</a>.</li></ul>
        <li><b>Searching: </b>Spend <strong>&bull;</strong>  to <a href="#features">search</a> in the current hex.</li>
        <li><b>Hunting: </b>Same procedure as Searching.</li>
        <li><b>Camping?: </b> Follow the <a href="#camping">camping</a> procedure.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Repeat until the day's time is spent.</li>
    <li><b>Nighttime:</b> Roll 1 encounter check for each point of terrain cost (2 checks in Tough Terrain).<br>
        Roll 1 less encounter check for each action the players take in fiction to hide themselves, but always roll 
        one check at a minimum.<br>
        Make sure the characters have Eaten, Drank and Slept to prevent Deprivation.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="points">Travel Points <strong>&bull;</strong></h2>
<p>Determine how many points you are able to 'spend' on the players' behalf depending on the mode of travel:</p>

</table>
<p><b>Remember:</b> the xin6 chance, and the search die is modified by Rangers and shitty weather.</p>

<h2 id="morningCheck">Lost? Encounter?</h2>
<p>You roll two d6, one light and one dark, and compare them against the type of terrain you expect the party to 
    travel in throughout the day.<br></p>
<div class="boxedText" style="margin-left: 10pt;">
    <p><b>Modifiers:</b> Modify the x in 6 chance if:</p>
    <ol><li>In a ranger's favoured biome, -1 to the lost chance, and any encounters occur at +4 range.</li>
    <li>Traveling Carefully, -1 to encounter chance, and any encounters occur at +2 range.</li></ol>
</div>

<p><b>Lost: </b>Rolling on or under the terrain cost on a d6 indicates the party will get their travel direction wrong at some 
point in the day. You don't need to directly inform them they are lost, but could hint at the fact.<br>
At one point when they would change position to a new hex, roll a d6 and adjust their movement as follows:</p>
<ol style="margin-left: 10pt;">
    <li>They have traveled in the completely wrong direction, and move backward one hex.</li>
    <li>They have circled back on themselves, and end in the same hex as they started.</li>
    <li>Same as 2.</li>
    <li>They have strayed off course, and moved to the hex to the RIGHT on their intended direction.</li>
    <li>They have strayed off course, and moved to the hex to the LEFT of their intended direction.</li>
    <li>Luckily they have blindly wandered into the hex they intended to travel to.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Encounter:</b> Rolling on or under the terrain cost on a d6 indicates the party will face an encounter at some point in 
the adventuring day. You can choose when this happens, or roll a d12 and let that dictate the hour it occurs.<br>
Be sure to roll for <a href="rng_rec">Range and Reaction</a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features - Seeing, Searching, Hunting</h2>
<p>The first time the characters enter a new hex, roll an appropriate 'search' die for that terrain type.<br>Rolling the maximum
    result means the party has stumbled across the hex's main feature. Roll only on the first time entering, after that, the players
    have to search.<br><br>
    When the players actively <b>Search</b>, or <b>Hunt</b> follow this procedure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spend the terrain type's <strong>&bull;</strong> cost.</li>
        <li><b>Secretly</b> roll the terrain types search die.</li>
        <ul><li>Rolling a die's maximum results in the players finding the hex's feature, and any secret locations.</li>
            <li>Rolling a die's maximum -1 results in them only finding the feature.</li>
            <li>Maximum when hunting means they hunted "d8 rations worth of meat", and a creatures' den.</li>
            <li>Maximum -1 means just the d8 rations of meat.</li></ul>
        <li>Roll another <a href="#encounters">Encounter Check</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br></p>
    <div class="boxedText" style="margin-left: 12px;"><p><b>Modify</b> results of the search die by:</p>
    <ul><li>+1 in a ranger's favoured terrain.</li><li>-1 for shitty weather</li></ul></div>

<h2 id="camping">Camping</h2>
<p>The characters need to eat, drink and sleep for at least 6 hours each day or be Deprived. Characters are also Deprived
    if they are sleeping outside, exposed to the elements. Each occurance of becoming Deprived 'stacks' and becomes Exhaustion.<br><br>
    If the players look for an advantageous place to camp or set a fire, roll a <b>Die of Fate.</b><br>
    See also: <a href="Economy.html#safe_sleep">Sleeping Inside.</a><br>
    The dangers of sleeping outside can be mitigated with Camping Gear. One character with Camping Gear covers the party.<br><br></p>
    
<ul>
    <li>If you spend the night in a tent, make a Charisma Save.</li>
    <ul><li>Success means you can heal 1 point of Ability loss.</li></ul>
</ul>
<p>You can get up to a -4 bonus to the Charisma Save by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Eating a hot, cooked meal before bed: -2</li>
    <ul><li>Cooking requires a fire, and a Mess Kit.</li></ul>
    <li>Enjoying the company of your friends: -2</li>
    <ul><li>One character can tell a story or sing a song, then succeed on a Charisma Save.</li></ul>
</ul>
<h3>Fire</h3>
<p>Each character gathering wood will find 1d6 hours of wood by spending 20 minutes foraging.<br>
That's in a forest, reduce the d6 as appropriate.<br><br>
Starting a fire requires either a tinderbox, or 30 minutes and a Dex save.<br>
If conditions are bad, put an xin6 chance on the tinderbox or a penalty on the Dex save.</p>
<p><br>It should always be a trade-off to have a fire or not. Here are some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fire provides vision for watches (otherwise, Charisma saves to see approaching threats are made at +4).</li>
    <li>Fires can be seen from afar (When making encounter checks at night, adjust the xin6 chance by -2)...<br>
        ...unless the players have been crafty and hid the fire away somehow...</li>
    <li>If you are in freezing temperatures, a fire is <b>REQUIRED</b>.</li>
    <ul><li>If the characters sleep in the freezing elements without a fire:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>They are going to lose d8 Dexterity, and</li>
        <li>they have to pass a Dexterity save in the morning to not be frozen to death.</li>
        <li>If they survive, they are Deprived.</li>
    </ul></ul>
</ul>

<h1>Sailing</h1>
<p>Got a ship? They can travel 20 six mile hexes in a day (1.2hours per) or 3 thirty six mile hexes (8 hr per)<br><br>
xin6 chance for encounters or being lost is based on weather: Calm 1in6, Iffy 2in6, Stormy 3in6.<br><br>
Give each character a job, and on days that there are no encounters, choose a player and make up some minor problem they
have  with the job, a slight drama to deal with or ask them a question re: what they see.</p>


<h1 id="dungcrawl">Dungeon Crawling</h1>
<ol style="margin-left: 8px;">
    <li>Describe the surroundings, ask what they are doing.</li>
    <ul><li>Don't let one player dominate, ask "And what are <i>You</i> doing while <i>He</i> does that?".</li></ul>
    <li>Each action takes a 10 minute turn. In it you can:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Search a Room.</li>
        <li>Take a break to refresh hp.</li>
        <li>Cover about 120' at a normal pace.</li>
        <li>check an area for traps.</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
        <ul><li><b>No need for Saves unless there is time pressure.</b></li></ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Restate the character's surroundings and ask again what they are up to now.</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<div class="boxedText">
<p>Make an encounter check:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Every third turn (every second in dangerous areas).</li>
    <li>When the characters do something noisy.</li>
    <li>When the <i><b>Players</b></i> can't seem to make up their mind for a while.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br><br><b>Note:</b> not all dungeons are underground. Treat point crawls, city crawls and forest crawls in the same manner.</p>



<h1>Advice</h1>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>Not everything speaks common. Once again, for me this time "<b>Not everything speaks common!</b>" I forget too, and it's usually more
    interesting to speak to the little assholes instead of just killing them. Mausritter did it best. Each creature variety speaks there own
    racial language. The more similar they are in species, the more likely they can <i>~kind of~</i> communicate.<br>
    Kobolds can kinda speak dragon. Goblins can kinda speak Orc, who can kinda speak human.<br>
    Also, roadblocks are good sometimes, let the wizard get creative.</p>

<h3>Traps</h3>
<p>Traps should have <b>No Obvious Solutions!</b> but easily discernable. Give them multiple solutions, or let clever ideas 
work to circumvent it.<br>
Avoid requiring specific items or tools. That's a lock, not a trap.<br><br>
Some traps can be easy to break, avoid. They become tools for the players to use against enemies.</p>
<p>The best traps are obvious, they need:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
    <li>A reason to engage</li>
    <li>A visible mechanism</li>
    <li>An explicit risk</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, put them in logical places. Busy hallways suck. Tucked away closets and cupboards are best.</p>

<h3>Regions</h3>
<p>What is here and why. Come up with a theme to use as a touchstone. Where does food and 'work' come from?
    Pick a couple factions, and note what they want here. Note a few wild creatures.<br><br>
    <b>THEN:</b>Drop a handful of dice onto a sheet of paper. Circle where they fall, and note the die result within.<br>
        Higher die sizes give more rare locations, up to d12.</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>#</th><th>Fantasy</th><th>Sci-Fantasy</th><th></th><th>#</th><th>Fantasy</th><th>Sci-Fantasy</th></tr>

</table>
<p>Draw some lines that connect the nodes, these are known travel routes. <br>
Even to Even is generally safe for travel, Odd to Odd has a known danger.<br>
Roughly scale out the line lengths: Short lines= d6 hexes between, Mid= 2d6 hexes, and long= 3d6 hexes.<br><br>
Most importantly, made a d6 Random encounter list that follows <a href="#rndEncLst">this</a> formula.</p>

<h3>Sites</h3>
<p>Similar to region design, try to come up with a concept before meticulously mapping out a site. Think about what the location 
    was, and what it is now. Roll on some tables for inspiration. <br><br>
    Think about what NPCs, Creators and Factions could be in here, and what they may want.<br>
    Make one of those creatures a <b>Weird Little Guy</b> that fucking loves it here. <br><br>
    Think about what the 'reward' for coming here is, why the PCs should bother at all. Write it down as your hook.<br><br>
    Finally, think about a <b>theme</b>. It's important, and will help answer questions later.
<br><br><br>With all that in mind, grab a handful of d6, and a sheet of paper. Plan on 3 or 4 exploration turns per die, as 
each die represents numerically to how many exploration turns that 'node' will take to traverse.<br>
Each 'node' could be one large room, or several daisy chained rooms.<br>
If a d6 averages 3.5, I can assume (on average) that two dice should result in 1 hour of 10 minute turns, so If I want my cave to take the players
4 hours of 'in game' time to delve, I would roll 8 dice onto a page.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Circle where each die landed, and note the number of turns spent in that 'node'.</li>
    <li>Then, for each 'node' roll a d6 again, this time reference the chart below for what the contents of that 'node' is.</li>
</ol>

<p>Draw a few lines to connect up your nodes. Think about stairs, and loops. Old dungeon heads call it 'jaquaising' the dungeon.<br>
This is all representational at the moment. You could run it as a point crawl as is, but if you are feeling artistic, sit 
down with some graph paper and draw some squares. Remember that each 'node' takes d6 turns to explore, so don't pad out the 
time with long corridors (unless the corridor is your 'zone')</p>
<h3>Keying</h3>
<p>If you are going to key the place for later use, follow the Landmark ( hidden[ secret ] ) philosophy.<br>
<b>Landmarks</b> are common knowledge, seen without searching, but may include more details when examined. The dresser is a landmark.<br>
<b>( Hidden )</b> information is just that. Only revealed with a bit of time. The contents of the dresser's bottom drawer is hidden.<br>
<b>[ Secret ]</b> information needs a bit of time, AND luck. You can make it a save, but if the players come up with a compelling arguement,
give it to them. The trip-wire and bell connected to the backside of the drawer is Secret knowledge.<br><br>
<b>Use this philosophy keying everything.</b><br><br>
Here is an example, as I don't where else to put it.<br>
<b>Room 6</b> - Bedroom<br>
A strong musky smell, a <b>Bookcase</b> stands on the Northern wall. Tatty curtains cover a <b>window</b> to the east. The scent 
originates from a lump in the <b>bed</b>.</p>
<ul><li><b>Bookcase:</b>Detailed Carving, water damage (leather armour in bottom drawer [ string attached to back rings loud bell] )</li>
    <li><b>Bed:</b> Describe the <b>lump</b> here.</li>
    <ul><li><b>Lump: </b>details below</li></ul>
    <li><b>Window: </b>and on and on and on</li>
