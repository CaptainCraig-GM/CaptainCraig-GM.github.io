<h1>Combat !!</h1>
<p>When push comes to shove things get serious quickly. This game has no to hit roll, so <b>somebody is taking damage each turn</b>. You simply
state your target, roll your weapon die, and the target takes that much damage. <i>That applies for the enemies on their turn as well!</i><br>
Some things of note:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initiative is side based, so all allies attack, then all enemies attack. This varies round after round so you (<i>or enemies</i>) may get 
    two turns in a row.</li>
    <li>Movement is 'zone' based, an abstract area that relates to other areas. A living room is one zone, while the grand staircase is 
        another, while the upstairs balcony is a third.<br>
        You can travel to an adjacent zone and do something, or move to a faraway zone, if your movement is not blocked.
    </li>
    <li>Stacking 5 attackers on one target doesn't work. <b>Only one damage die result applies (the highest).</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Get creative to offset this. Use tactics. Grabbing and pinning an enemy down may grant Enhanced damage for the turn.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Actions occur in roughly this order: <b>Missiles, Movement, Melee, Magic</b>. With Initiative winners acting first, and losers following.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>If you lose initiative and take Ability damage on your turn, you will lose any ranged attack, or any spell cast.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Combat Structure</h2>
<p>If one side is unaware of an incoming attack, the damage goes straight off of the target's Strength score, hp does not apply. Once both
    sides are aware of the conflict:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>I'll describe the scene around you, and recap the last few seconds. We'll reference a whiteboard if we need it for positioning ourselves in the zones.</li>
    <li>I'll describe the enemies' intent for the upcoming round. Basically what will happen if you do nothing.</li>
    <li>You'll describe what you want to do this round. Who you are attacking, what weapon, what spells.</li>
    <ul><li>I need to know your melee and ranged targets. If you are casting a spell, and how many Magic Die you are using.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, I need to know if you are doing a special maneuver this round!</li></ul>
    <li>One player will roll a d6 for initiative: 4-6 wins initiative for the round.</li>
    <li>I'll describe the actions of the initiative winners calling for rolls as they are needed, then follow suit with the losers.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>When you lose initiative, you run the risk of losing an action !!</li>
        <ul>If you are attacking at range, or casting a spell and you take Ability score damage: you lose the attack / spell, but still
            expend the resource (arrow or M.D.). <i>This applies to enemies as well!</i>
        </ul>
        <li>If your chosen action is impossible to perform after losing initiative, you can adjust your course of action slightly.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>If the enemies have taken heavy casualties, I may have the leader make a Charisma save to see if the group wants to continue
        fighting. Most creatures would rather flee than fight to the death.</li>
        <ul><li>If they decide to continue to battle, we will return to step 1. Otherwise I'll state their intent to flee the next round.</li></ul>
</ol>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Out of all enemies attacking one target, only the highest damage die applies for the round.<br>
When attempting maneuvers in combat, the side most at risk makes a save to prevent ill effects.<br>
Pushing for advantages with maneuvers can result in the Enhanced or Impaired status!!</p>
<h3>Crits:</h3>
<p>Whenever 2 or more dice are rolled against a singular target, and at least two dice roll maximum results, you've scored a critical hit!</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Double the damage.</b></li>
    <li>When the target rolls to prevent Critical Damage, the roll is made at +4.</li>
</ul> 


<h3>Zones:</h3>
<p>Try to break the area up into 2-4 zones, bonus points for making something intractable at each zone that changes the 
    battlefield in some way (I broke the statue, now there are glass shards everywhere!).

<h1 id="massComb">Mass Combat</h1>
<p>Mass combat is handled through Warbands / Detachments battling each other. Keep zone combat in mind in the
same way as you would regular combat.<br><br>
Players implementing a good strategy, the fiction's situation or strong defenses can inflict
Enhanced or Impaired damage when relevant.</p>

<h3>Structures</h3>
<p>Taking critical damage means the structure is breached or no longer provides protection. Repairing
the damage requires one half of the domain requirements to construct it.</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Structure</th><th>stats</th><th>Strength>/th></tr>
<tr><td>Gate</td><td>12hp2a</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wall</td><td>10hp2a</td><td>12</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tower</td><td>8hp2a</td><td>18</td></tr>
<tr><td>Keep</td><td>14hp3a</td><td>15</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hovel</td><td>4hp</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Inn</td><td>8hp1a</td><td>8</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Siege Weapons</h3>
<p>Taking critical damage means that the weapon has fallen apart and is no longer usable. Repairing
the machine takes one day and one third the weapon's cost in materials.</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Weapon</th><th>Stats</th><th>Strength</th><th>Damage</th><th>Cost</th></tr>
<tr><td>Ballista</td><td>6hp</td><td>6</td><td>d8</td>          <td>20 Silver</td></tr>
